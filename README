Title:
RunC++: automate c++ code testing scripts

Description:
Remember how easy it was to compile, test, and debug c code in CS136 class?
Just hit CTRL + R and the scripts does everything for you. In this course, the difference is this time we use c++. With a little bit of work, we could rewrite the runC script (from cs136 virtual machine) so that it now does c++.
Ok, so basically this folder contains scripts that were used in my cs246 class. These are bash script codes. They helped me test code faster.


Installation:
There is a script that gedit runs. Fire up gedit and go to:
Tools -> Manage External Tools
Add the code that is in Manage_External_Tools.txt
(Refer to Manage_External_Tools.jpg to setup gedit box)

Then:
mkdir ~/.cs246scripts

And now, put all the files there. 
Remember to "chmod +x <script_filename>", otherwise when you run a script you'll see "permission denied".
Eg: chmod +x runSuite
